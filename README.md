# Swaglabs WDIO GUI Tests

## Summary

Automated end-to-end GUI tests for SauceLabs' ["SwagLabs"](https://saucedemo.com) test website, mainly to play around with a simple [WebdriverIO v8](https://webdriver.io) automation framework setup. WDIO is both the test runner and asserter, paired with the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) test framework. It hooks into [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org) to control the browser.

All code is written in TypeScript, transpiled into ESM, and linted by ESLint and Prettier.

The goal of these tests are purely demonstrative of techniques for using WDIO, rather than actual testing of the chosen dummy/unfinished website. While most tests will pass, some of them are known to fail by design, just to showcase a comprehensive end-to-end testing plan. For example, the checkout page allows you to go through the flow without much validation (doesn't require a valid zip code or even an item "added" to work).

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome (last tested with version 126)
- Node.js (last tested with version LTS 20.15.1)
